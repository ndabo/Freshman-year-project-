TICTACTOE README

OVERVIEW:

TicTacToe is a game with two TicTacToePlayers competing against each other by placing their respective symbols (
“X”s and “O”s) on a TicTacToeBoard. The Controller is the “referee” of the game. his role is to switch turns,
check for a winner, and display updates about the gameplay. it has four support classes: CS15TicTacToeBoard--class that
models a 3x3 tic tac toe board and tracks the player's selected CS15TicTacToeSquares;
CS15TicTacToeController--class that controls the tic tac toe game and displays relevant game messages;
CS15TicTacToeFrame--class that handles adding the game frame to the scene and opening the tic tac toe application;
and CS15TicTacToeSquare-- a class that models one square of the CS15TicTacToeBoard.
it also has three other classes: the App class which models an application and contain my top-level class;
the TicTacToeGame class which is a top-level logic class that implements the CS15TicTacToeGame interface;
and the TicTacToePlayer which represent the players.

DESIGN CHOICE:

in this project, I used association in my TicTacToePlayer class in the constructor to let the player know about the
CS15TicTacToeBoard and the CS15TicTacToeController class. it was necessary because the player need to know about the
board, the controller and the symbol he is using, without this association there will not be a tictactoe game.
also in my TicTacToePlayer class I wrote an accessor that allow me to get the winning player in the TicTacToeGame class.
